# Wrisk unattended platform test

*We’re building the future of insurance by offering a new perspective on risk that makes insuring you, and your lifestyle, easy. The future of insurance is mobile first. The future of insurance is Wrisk. It’s a big claim, sure, but we mean it, and it’s a big job, which is why we need your help.*

## Scenario

At Wrisk we like to be transparent with our customers and make everything as easy as possible. In order to be transparent, we calculate a Wrisk score (think credit score for insurance) which is fed into our pricing models.

Your task is to write a program which can produce a quote and policy for a customer given their individual Wrisk score.

The solution should use gradle and kotlin. You don’t need to be a kotlin expert, none of us were before we started using it. We believe good programmers can easily pick up any language. Here is a resource [https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/kotlin/](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/kotlin/).

## Background

### Insurance product

Our contents insurance product is broken down into **Sections** such as general contents, electronics, jewelry, etc. Each section represents a broad category of goods containing a set of **Named Items** and/or a **Bundle**. Named items allow our customers to add individual items that they would like to insure, e.g. a wedding ring with a value of £500, whereas a bundle represents a collection of unnamed items. We provide a provide a discrete set of value options for customers to choose from for each bundle as follows:

| Section | Bundle value options (GBP)   |
|---------|------------------------------|
| General | 2500, 5000, 10000, 15000     |
| Jewelry | 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000 |


Note that in our current insurance product, each section can have a set of named items, a bundle, or both, which is configured as follows:

| Section     | Item options           |
|-------------|------------------------|
| General     | Bundle only            |
| Jewelry     | Named items and bundle |
| Electronics | Named items only       |
| Bicycles    | Named items only       |


### Pricing model

The price that a customer is quoted for each named item/ bundle is calculated as

*(W<sup>max</sup>/W) × V × (1 - E/V) × 0.0015 × M*

where *1 <= W <= W<sup>max</sup>* is the Wrisk score with *W<sup>max</sup> = 1000*, *V > 0*  is the value (or sum insured) of the item/bundle, *E* is the excess, and *M* is a section multiplier. As with the value of bundles, we provide a discrete set of excess options for customer to choose from when receiving a quote.

The following table lists the excess options and multiplier for each section: 

| Section     | Excess options          | Multiplier |
|-------------|-------------------------|------------|
| General     | 200, 300, 400           | 0.1        |
| Jewelry     | 100, 200, 300           | 2          |
| Electronics | 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 | 1          |
| Bicycles    | 300, 400, 500           | 0.8        |


## Task

### Part 1: QuoteGenerator

In order to optimise performance in our mobile app, we generate a quote for all the possible options for our users. This means that we generate a quote with upfront prices calculated for all value/excess combinations.

You should write a solution which calculates a quote for the following customers

| Name         | Wrisk Score | Bundles Selected          | Named Items (Name:Category:Value) |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Rick Sanchez | 1000        | General Contents          | Portal Gun: Electronics: 2000     |
| Morty Smith  | 20          | General Contents, Jewelry | Schwinn Bike: Bicycles: 500       |
| Jerry Smith  | 1           | General Contents          | Wedding Ring: Jewelry: 400        |

The **QuoteGenerator** should take in a list of which bundles were chosen and a list of named items to produce a price quote matrix with all potential price options for each item. 

### Part 2: PolicyGenerator

After we provide the quote for the customer, they can choose the excess for each named item and the value/excess combination for each bundle. They should then see the total price before taking a policy with Wrisk.

At Wrisk we use a microservices based architecture, with services communicating via HTTP and known contracts between the services. In the template project, the policy-contracts have been included for you to use as the output from the PolicyGenerator.

You should write a solution which takes the quotes generated in part 1 to produce a policy for each customer’s selection as provided below.

**Rick Sanchez:**

| Name (Bundle/Item) | Value Choice | Excess |
|--------------------|--------------|--------|
| General Contents   | 2500         | 200    |
| Portal Gun         | 2000         | 300    |


**Morty Smith:**

| Name (Bundle/Item) | Value Choice | Excess |
|--------------------|--------------|--------|
| General Contents   | 5000         | 300    |
| Schwinn Bike       | 500          | 300    |


**Jerry Smith:**

| Name (Bundle/Item) | Value Choice | Excess |
|--------------------|--------------|--------|
| General Contents   | 15000        | 400    |
| Wedding Ring       | 400          | 300    |
